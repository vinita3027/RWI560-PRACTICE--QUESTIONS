Unary Operators:

Unary operators are operators that operate on a single operand. This means they only require one operand to perform the operation. Examples of unary operators include:

Unary minus (-): negates the value of its operand.

Unary plus (+): indicates a positive value, but doesn't actually change the value.

Increment (++) and Decrement (--): increment or decrement the value of its operand by one.

Logical NOT (!): negates the logical value of its operand.



Binary Operators:

Binary operators, on the other hand, operate on two operands. These operators require two operands to perform the operation. Examples of binary operators include:

Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/): perform arithmetic operations on two operands.

Assignment (=): assigns a value to a variable.

Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=): compare two values and return a boolean result.
